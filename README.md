this app is for a companies sales and warehouse department.
it's used for calculating the weight and volume of products, which is for choosing the best truck type considering the costumers order.
this company manufactures two diffrent types of products each in a diffrent location. since each warehouse has it's own staff, sometimes cordinating between two takes some time. in order to make it convinient, I've made this app and each group of pruducts in it's own tab.

the products names, volumes and weights are stored in a 3d array.
each of [0][x][x] and [1][x][x] are for a group of them.


it still misses some features so i will continue to develop this code.
