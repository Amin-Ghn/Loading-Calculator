this app is for a companies sales department and loading dock.
it's used for calculating the weight and volume of products, which is for choosing the best truck considering the costumers order.
this company manufactures sanitary and vanity ware.
since each group of the products loads in a diffrent location, I've made a tab for each of them.

the products names, volumes and weights are stored in a 3d array.
each of [0][x][x] and [1][x][x] are for a group of them.


it still misses some features so i will continue to develop this code for now.
